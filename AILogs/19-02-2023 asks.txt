Notes for a later commit

Date: 19/12/2023
- Make the hanging effect only when the character is going down and to make it consistent add a hanging point to the hangable object
- Refactor to states but keep the HangController separated for non hanging characters
- Add a Drop mechanism
- Add a move along mechanism
- Debug and Trying to move along problems. The resulted suggestion is to migrate to a path system and keep the hangingEdgeDirection updated
